Conclusion :
The data analysis revealed that women were the primary buyers, accounting for approximately 65% of total sales. The analysis also identified the top three states that contributed to sales, namely Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, accounting for approximately 35% of total sales.
